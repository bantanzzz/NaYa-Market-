## 🎯 Key Benefits of Blaze Plan

### **Before (Free Plan):**
- ❌ Images stored as data URLs in Firestore
- ❌ Limited to 1MB per document
- ❌ Slow loading with large images

- ❌ Storage not available

### **After (Blaze Plan):**
- ✅ Images stored in Firebase Storage
- ✅ Unlimited image sizes
- ✅ Fast CDN delivery
- ✅ Professional image handling

## 🔍 How It Works Now

### **Image Upload Process:**
1. User selects image in vendor form
2. Image previews immediately
3. On form submit, image uploads to Firebase Storage
4. Storage returns a download URL
5. Product saves to Firestore with Storage URL
6. Image appears instantly on main page

### **Image Storage Structure:**
```
product-images/
├── Product_Name_1234567890.jpg
├── Another_Product_1234567891.jpg
└── ...
```

### **Automatic Cleanup:**
- When products are deleted, images are automatically removed from Storage
- No orphaned images left behind
- Efficient storage management

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Storage Rules:**
- Current rules allow public read/write for simplicity
- **For production**, consider restricting uploads to authenticated users
- Monitor your Storage usage in Firebase Console

### **Cost Management:**
- Blaze plan charges for actual usage
